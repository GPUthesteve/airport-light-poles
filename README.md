im bored so i made this library, customizable library light to use w/ fsx/p3d airport projects.

Well, it contains BGL Library of "Lights" and effect itself (I use effect so there will be backward compatiblity to FSX).
You can place it using ADE as internal Library or use sth like visual scenery editor "Simdirector." for p3d or FSX's Object Placement Tool located in SDK..

About lighting effects, it's pretty simple to edit its color using this arrangement

            R    G  B  size(255 max)
Color Start=255, 0, 0, 255
Color End=255, 0, 0, 255

Texturing...its simple...or complicated? some random UV were made there so...its just solid color. I'm not texture artist also so bear with it or edit it as you like
there's pole, guard and lamp cover. the color of light will correspond to lamp cover and effect.

Night texture? I let the simulator handle the pole...except the cover that I use the day texture for it...and it lits so its fine for now.
